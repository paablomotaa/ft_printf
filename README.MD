# ft_printf

### Description

This project simulates the operation of printf from the stdio.h library. 
It simulates the following types:
- %c to print a single character
- %s to print a string of characters.
- %p to print a void * pointer.
- %d to print a number in decimal base.
- %i to print an integer in base 10.
- %u to print an unsigned decimal number.
- %x to print a hexadecimal number in lowercase.
- %X to print a hexadecimal number in uppercase.
- %% to print the percent symbol.

### Instructions

To run the program, you must execute make to ensure that the library is installed correctly. Then, you must uncomment the main in the ft_printf.c file and run it normally.
